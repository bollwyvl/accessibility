# Accessibility

Welcome to the Github repository for the accessibility working group of [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). This group is being formed in early 2019. Its goal is to gather stakeholders who can actively work with the project to make Jupyter's core user-facing software accessible. In particular, the initial targets are:

*   [Classic Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)
*   [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)
*   [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub)

To be clear, as of March 2019 this software is not accessible. Significant work will be required to reach that goal.

[**Check out the accessibility section of the community forum**](https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/special-topics/accessibility) for  
ongoing conversations and brainstorms around accessibility in the Jupyter ecosystem.

[**Join our JupyterLab accessibility meetings from the community calendar**](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html#jupyter-community-meetings)

## Working Group Members

Once we have assembled the working group, we will list the members here.

## Links to accessibility standards and resources

One of our goals is to collect information about accessibility and create documentation to empower the Jupyter community to help us make our software accessible. Please use this section to begin to aggregate relevant third party standards, guides, and documentation related to this:

*   [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) - W3C Recommendation
*   [The A11 Project](https://a11yproject.com/)
*   [18F Accessibility Guide](https://accessibility.18f.gov/)
*   [The tota11y toolbar](https://khan.github.io/tota11y/) is a lightweight javascript toolbar for quick a11y analysis.
*   [The WAVE tool](http://wave.webaim.org/report#/http://z2jh.jupyter.org/) is a web analyzer for page accessibility.

## Links to Jupyter a11y tech

*   [Jupyter Notebook a11y toolbar](https://github.com/uclixnjupyternbaccessibility/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/accessibility_toolbar) (from Microsoft research)

## Links to accessibility related issues on GitHub

A number of open issue related to accessibility are already open on the repos above. Please help us to aggregate links to those here. The preferred way to do this is for each repo to have a unique GitHub label for accessibility, and then to link to the GitHub issue search that automatically lists those issues:

*   [Jupyter Notebook Accessibility Issues](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atag%3AAccessibility)
*   [JupyterHub Accessibility Issues](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccessibility)
*   [JupyterLab Accessibility Issues](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atag%3AAccessibility)

If there are additional issues we are missing, please help us by tagging them or listing them here.

### Bi-Weekly Meeting
