### Notes
- Welcome Thomas!

#### What are people working on?

- Martha
    - PRs [jupyterlab/lumino#129](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/129) 
    and [jupyterlab/lumino#131](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/131) merged!
    -Hooray for Martha! Great job getting that done!

- Max
    - Requesting review on [jupyterlab/lumino#132](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/132) 
    rebasing for lumino.

- Isabela
    - PR for JupyterLab color contrast updates at 
    [#9335](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/9335). 
    This means it has a binder to test. Original issue is 
    [#8832](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/8832)
    - Started sorting through the web of repos where accessibility 
    work was started as issues (based on Phosphor Walkthrough 
    meeting notes). Nothing to show yet.

#### Next Steps
- Martha will test her PRs with NVDA.
- Martha will make an issue for isToggleable additions to 
[#9365](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9365). 
Will also start working on it.
- Max will update [jupyterlab/lumino#132](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/132) 
with the items on the checklist.
    - Also create a binder.
- Thomas will review JupyterLab and perform an audit of all/most of 
the accessibility issues needing to be addressed to ensure an 
optimal user experience for all users with visual, auditory, 
ambulatory, or cognitive handicaps. Goal will be to uncover all 
that is needed to become fully WCAG 2.1 compliant. Will be using 
JAWS for the screenreader when a screenreader is necessary, but 
reported issues will be for all of them, not screenreader specific.
    - Setup following https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/contributing.html
    - maybe `pip install â€”pre jupyterlab`
    - Post issues to [jupyterlab repo](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) 
    with [accessibility label](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atag%3AAccessibility).
- Isabela will consolidate the accessibility issues across repos 
where appropriate (probably [jupyterlab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) 
or [lumino](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino)). Will bring the 
new issues for the next meeting so we can keep moving forward with 
the problems we already know about.
