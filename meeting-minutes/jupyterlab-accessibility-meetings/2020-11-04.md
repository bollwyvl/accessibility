### Notes

If needed, recap/point to the notes and resources for our Phosphor 
PR meeting last Monday for people who weren't able to make it.
- Covered what decisions were made and our current goals (transfer 
the problems we already know about in Phosphor to Lumino and finish 
off what was originally Hack4All work).

Are these meetings something we'd want to have on the Jupyter 
community calendar?
- Yes! It will be brought up in next week's JupyterLab team meeting 
for approval/necessary steps.

- Need to see if we can find or get data on what developers who use 
screen readers use in terms of OS

#### What are people working on?
- Martha: [#129](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/129) - 
Moved PR from phosphor to lumino, reviewers?
- Gonzalo: Following up on Phosphor tutorial videos. Confirmed we 
can repost them, but need to get license.
    - Also need a PR for Lumino docs once the videos get set up.

#### Next Steps
- Alex: Review [#129](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/129) 
Add isToggleable command state.
- Gonzalo: Get final info about reposting Phosphot tutorial videos 
for Lumino docs
- Isabela: Move Phosphor issues to Lumino. Also consolidate issues 
from other repos where relevant so we don't have to look for issues 
across as many repos anymore.
- Goal
    - Once those three Phosphor PRs are fully up and ready to be 
    reviewed/merged, then we can reach out to experts to talk more.
    - Potentially asking for  a meeting where we watch experts 
    test PRs so we can learn how to better test too (and not just 
    rely on them).
