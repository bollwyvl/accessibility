### Notes
- From JupyterLab Team meeting 12.23.20 discussion
    - > Is single-document mode the more accessible UI? [compared 
    to JupyterLab default]
    - Thomas says Classic is better, but since that's not being 
    updated we need to keep it relevant
    - Can't move tabs on a screen reader
    - Focus on navbar and notebook. Will this help make jupyterlab 
    and classic accessible together?
    - Having less things on screen could be helpful because it 
    means you can focus on having those things being navigable, 
    but it also can risk hiding functions and making things less 
    usable.
    - jaws, nvda, focus on low vision ambulatory users because at 
    the moment things are completely inaccessible to blind users 
    and will keep being so until we fix these needs first.
    - project manager to get different places. need a foundation.
    - Can't currently evaluate JLab well because you can't even 
    navigate it right now. Keyboard accessibility and tab order 
    are key place to start.

- Agenda item from Chris Holdgraf: "Don't forget that we have a 
little bit of funding from Bloomberg to run some kind of event 
around accessibility."
    - We agreed that we need to follow up on how much money this is 
    to know what we want to do with it.
    - Parts of the work might be good/more contained project that 
    we can get funding for. Maybe the accessible editor is an option?
 - What's the strategy?
    - Thomas would like to see all [#9399](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9399)
     and [#9491](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9491) 
     in next six months. These issues make JupyterLab 
     navigable/readable so that it can be more finely evaluated and 
     so that you can even reach the editor experience.
    - Currently can't create new notebooks, or change kernel with 
    keyboard alone?
    - 6 months: everyone but blind users can use jupyter
    - 12 months: everyone can use JupyterLab
    - Can we convince people to act by framing some of these 
    things as helping multiple problems (like a better mobile 
    experience)?
    - Would not recommend splitting the team up because we don't 
    have a lot of people who have an accessibility background, so 
    it might be best to keep our knowledge together.

- Goals for next JupyterLab release? What would we want to 
prioritize?
    - We think we can do it without formally being a part of 
    the release schedule. See above for priorities.
    - Do the work, show it, and it is usually easier to get 
    it incorporated.

### Next steps
- Mark which things are we looking to work on first and make 
sure they are ready to be assigned next meeting (Isabela).
- Look into having regular sprints or other group times to 
work so we can help learn from each other.
- Have a happy new year!
