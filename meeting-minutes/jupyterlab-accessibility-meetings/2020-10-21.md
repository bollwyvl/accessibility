### Notes

#### Logistic check in 
- Does this time seem like it will keep working? Yes.
- If so I’d rather schedule it further out and add it somewhere 
more public so people can drop in. I can bring this up in JLab 
team meeting too, if so.

#### Proposed Goals
We'd like to propose concrete accessibility goals would be so that 
we can organize it into JupyterLab's release cycle and encourage 
people to focus on them. These are some ideas of where to start.
- Max brought up screen readers. Find most common and start from 
that paradigm.
  - discussion on github: https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/14
- Keyboard accessibility.
- Closing accessibility issues that already exist. There's already 
been work pointing out some of the issues (like here 
https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+web4all)
- Can we produce guidelines/docs/resources (or something similar)? 
This might help other people get involved and make the effort more 
sustainable.
- Creating an actionable plan and possibly getting some grant 
money/full time help

#### What are people working on?
Isabela
- Reached out to Tania Allard and Chris Holdgraf. They made point 
to keep all discussions online, so there shouldn’t be anything we 
are missing. Haven’t heard from Tania. This just means I’m trying 
to collect and understand what has already happened so we don’t 
redo or overlook existing work.
- Here’s some common places these discussions live (in Jupyter):
    - Jupyter Discourse accessibility Category https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/special-topics/accessibility/29
    - Jupyter accessibility repo https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility
    - JupyterLab accessibility issue label https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atag%3AAccessibility
    - Jupyter Notebook accessibility issue label https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/labels/tag%3AAccessibility
    - JupyterHub accessibility issue label https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/labels/accessibility
- Accessibility resource doc. WIP. Please feel free to add so we can 
help each other learn. Don’t let it get in the way of doing other 
work, but add as you find useful things. https://docs.google.com/document/d/12cusZV0j91yZTty_BQndorwTIgRloKR7WEWP2aGNp5A/edit?usp=sharing

#### Next steps
- Install NVDA or JAWS and gain familiarity with screen readers 
in general as well as JupyterLab
- Isabela needs to triage existing JupyterLab issues so we can 
assign/move forward with them
- Try and reconvene hackathon group to make sure we are understanding 
the same issues and have proper context to move forward and not 
repeat work that's already been started.
- Explore Phosphor and Lumino accessibility issues and PRs. This 
might be the metaphorical root of a lot of our problems. 
    - Big PRs in the DOM and menu system that started but did not 
    get finished
- Look for grants for funding a full-time accessibility dev
- Schedule meeting with Jason catching us up on work that's been 
done in Phosphor
- Explore Firefox accessibility tools. They've been recommended 
as a good starting point.
