### Notes

- There are overlap in infrastructure needs for an accessible 
JupyterLab and mobile/tablet support for JupyterLab. Maybe this 
is an opportunity to get more people involved in this work since 
there have been a lot of requests for mobile/tablet support.

Triage of existing accessibility issues
**This will be cross-referenced, updated with #9399, and stored 
in this [project](https://github.com/orgs/jupyterlab/projects/1) 
from here on out.**
- Reviewed from [diagram-codesprint/phosphor](https://github.com/diagram-codesprint/phosphor), 
[diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab](https://github.com/diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab), 
[phosphorjs/phosphor](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor/), 
[jupyterlab/lumino](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/), and 
[jupyterlab/jupyterlab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/labels/tag%3AAccessibility) 
([jupyter/accessibility](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues) has been more organizing focused).
- Isabela proposes continuing to focus on what was found in Hack4All first.
    - [#6577](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6577)
    - [#6578](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6578)
    - [#6579](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6579)
    - [#6580](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6580)
    - [#6581](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6581)
    - [#6582](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6582)
    - [#9365](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9365) Follow up for jupyterlab/lumino #129 that applies isToggleable to JLab now that it is possible with Lumino (Martha started this!)
    
- Issues Isabela wants to look into more
    - JLab [#6575](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6575) 
    (update of diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab #8) Has merged PR #6359, but 
    didnâ€™t close the issue.
    - JLab [#6576](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6576) 
    (update of diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab #9) and [#6404](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6404) Looks like a reference for UX of these accessibility changes and proposed solutions.
    - JLab [#1095](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/1095) 
    Visual/additional/any cues for running commands (this was to be put 
    to phosphor, review if it was already done or not)
    - JLab [#911](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/911) 
    An audit issue about what seems to be the first JLab 
    accessibility review. I need to check if they are or need to be 
    represented in other issues.
    - diagram-codesprint/phosphor [#2](https://github.com/diagram-codesprint/phosphor/pull/2) 
    and [#3](https://github.com/diagram-codesprint/phosphor/pull/3) 
    status. Did they get merged into Phosphor ever?
    - diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab [#4](https://github.com/diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab/pull/4) 
    and [#11](https://github.com/diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab/pull/11) status. 
    Did they ever get merged into JupyterLab?

- Other issues
    - [#6573](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6573) 
    NVDA tests on JLab. (Not explicitly tied to Hack4All, but seems 
    like it was part of it.)
    - [#4878](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4878) 
    Older screen reader evaluation with good discussion. Has been 
    mentioned in a few issues and PRs so it would probably be good 
    to brush up on.

#### What are people working on?
- Max and Jason
    - [jupyterlab/lumino#132](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/132) 
    still needs review.
- Thomas
    - Opened [#9399](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9399)
    - This is a full review of JupyterLab accessibility, can be 
    broken up into other issues as we go.
    - Evaluation is on JLab v.2.26 This should catch a lot of 
    what holds over to 3.0, but we will be facing new problems 
    with virtual notebook.
    - We started discussing how we pull this apart to tackle it
        - Tabs/tab order are the blockers that prevent further 
        evaluation, so they should be high up on our list
        - Order top to bottom should work in order of what are 
        most critical and/or rely on one another
    - This is a great review! Thank you so much!
- Isabela
   - Collecting and triaging existing issues as listed above.

#### Next Steps
- Max created a project to track JupyterLab accessibility work 
https://github.com/orgs/jupyterlab/projects/1. This will be how 
we organize and keep track of work in the future.
- Isabela and Tony will compare and consolidate #9399 with 
pre-existing issues.
    - Isabela also needs to check for duplicate issues and 
    close/update as needed.
    - Triage marking by WCAG standard and maybe level of complexity?
- Martha #9365 applying isToggleable to JLab now that it is 
possible in Lumino is still happening. This will be her next step.
- Time to reach out to experts and say we want to meet in the 
future (also gives us a deadline for some of the commitments)
